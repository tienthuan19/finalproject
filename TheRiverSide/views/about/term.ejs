            <p>Please read the following terms carefully before proceeding with your purchase and payment. By making a purchase decision, you agree to our terms of use. These terms may change from time to time and you will be bound by the terms displayed from the time you read these terms. We always want to bring customers the best quality service. You should not rely on this article as legal advice or as recommendations regarding what you should actually do, because we cannot know in advance what are the specific refund policies that you wish to establish between your business and your customers.</p>

            <h2 class="terms-subtitle">Terms and conditions - the basics</h2>
            <p>When you provide us with your purchase information, we are allowed to use that information to complete the delivery process, resolve any problems that may arise after the purchase process, and use it to take care of and send you promotional information (that may) be available during future sales activities.  Online businesses selling products are sometimes required (depending on local laws and regulations) to present their product return policy and refund policy. In some jurisdictions, this is needed in order to comply with consumer protection laws. It may also help you avoid legal claims from customers that are not satisfied with the products they purchased.</p>
